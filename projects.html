            <h2 class="heading2">Spotify Playlist Downloader</h2>
            <p class="content1">Many individuals do not possess access to Spotify Premium, which can be a hindrance when it comes to downloading songs from a playlist. Manually searching for each song on platforms like YouTube and then downloading them individually can be a time-consuming process. As a solution to this challenge, I have developed a program that simplifies the process. Users are required to input a link to any publicly accessible Spotify playlist. Subsequently, they can select both the destination folder for downloads and the specific songs they wish to acquire from the playlist. This program not only saves time but also eliminates the necessity for a Spotify Premium subscription to download songs.</p>

            <h2 class="heading2">Hand Mapping Program with advanced GUI</h2>
            <p class="content1">This program is designed to map your hand moments in real time using your webcam. The program uses Google's Mediapipe library to map your hand gestures with surprising accuracy even at times when your fingers are not directly visible. This is then complemented by an advanced GUI that displays the video input and then the output on a different window along with other information you might require such as fps, and much more.</p>

            <h2 class="heading2">Downloads Folder Organizer</h2>
            <p class="content1">Many individuals encounter the issue of cluttered downloads folders over time, which can become quite cumbersome. Recognizing this common problem, I embarked on the creation of a program designed to alleviate this inconvenience. This program's primary function is to systematically organize the contents of your downloads folder into distinct categories such as Documents, Videos, Executables, and more. Furthermore, it offers the flexibility to further categorize specific file types into subfolders, such as .docs or .pdfs, within their respective parent folders. One of the key advantages of this program is its seamless operation in the background, ensuring that your files are sorted automatically immediately after they are downloaded.</p>
